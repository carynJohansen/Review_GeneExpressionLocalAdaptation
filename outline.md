# Working Title: The role Gene Expression in Measuring/Establishing/Determining Local Adaptation

Driving Question: How can gene expression be used to study local adaptation?

### Important Concepts to define

* local adaptation
  * a population has higher fitness in it's local environment compared to another population
  * this increase in fitness comes at the cost of fitness in other environments
  * Savolainen et al.
  *
* gene expression (? maybe I don't need to define, but I think I do need to define the scope and what I am specifically discussing)

### Background on local adaptation

#### How local adaptation is studied

Savolainen et al.

Bradshaw et al. - haven't yet read.

Experimental designs to study local adaptation:

- common gardens
- reciprocal transplant experiments (subset of common garden)

Looking for phenotypic variation along environmental clines

Data:

- genetic information to get population genetics - Fst
- morphological traits - Qst

#### Causes of local adaptation
