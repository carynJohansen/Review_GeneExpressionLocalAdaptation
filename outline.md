# Working Title: The role Gene Expression in Measuring/Establishing/Determining Local Adaptation

## Thoughts

Driving Question: How can gene expression be used to study local adaptation?

Can study SNPs, but there is a lot of other points of regulation that can impact the final gene product. 
Use eQTLs to narrow down causal sequence variation.
What information does only looking at genetic sequence and/or morpholocial traits miss? How can gene expression bolster/support/supplement that information?

### Important Concepts to define

* local adaptation
  * a population has higher fitness in it's local environment compared to another population
  * this increase in fitness comes at the cost of fitness in other environments
  * Savolainen et al.
  *
* gene expression (? maybe I don't need to define, but I think I do need to define the scope and what I am specifically discussing)

## Sections

### Background on local adaptation

Intended to be short, as this is extensively covered in other reviews and papers

#### How local adaptation is studied

* Savolainen et al.
  * molecular methods
    * QTL mapping
    * Population genetics
    * association mapping
  * data
    * genetic sequence data - resequencing, whole genome, exome
    * reference genomes
    * trait phenotypes

* Bradshaw et al. - haven't yet read.
  * evolution of local adaptation due to climate change-mediated selection

* Experimental designs to study local adaptation:
  * common gardens
  * reciprocal transplant experiments (subset of common garden)

* Models of Local Adaptation
  * continuum
  * island

Looking for phenotypic variation along environmental clines


- genetic information to get population genetics - Fst
- morphological traits - Qst

#### Causes of local adaptation

Situations that local adaptation is likely to occur - Savolainen et al.

### Remaining unknowns about local adaptation

* the genetic architecture and the mechanisms underlying local adaptation - Savolainen et al.

### Gene expression

#### Tools used to measure gene expression

* RNA-Seq
* ATAC-Seq
* Methylation Sequencing

* Benefits and limitations of each of these tools (in the context of local adaptation)
  * experimental design can be tough
  * links between differential gene expression and trait is unclear

#### Experimental designs to maximize the use of RNA-Seq

### Role of gene expression

Which questions about local adaptation can studying gene expression answer?

* role of gene expression in speciation - Pavey et al. 
* mis-regulation as adaptive - Baym et al.
* gene expression variation and traits - Albert and Kruglyak

### Gene Expression supporting other methods

* Gene expression as both Fst and Qst
* Using gene expression to do population genetics
* using gene expression as a trait 
  * Cooper et al. 2003
  * Runcie and Mukherjee, 2013

### How gene expression can be used to study local adaptation

Gene expression can be both Fst and Qst

* it provides both genetic information and trait information
* rich data
* identify novel genetics
* analysis methods - algorithms for clustering, creating modules
* modeling to get biologically meaningful information from gene expression
* study impacts of sequence variation in regulation


### Previous examples and limitations to this approach

* Cooper et al. 2003
* others
