### Using gene expression profiles as a phenotypic trait, and as a high dimensional phenotype

* Runcie and Mukherjee, 2013.

### Linking Gene Expressions to traits

* direct vs indirect

	* Pavey et al. 2010. Discuss how gene expression directly or indirectly impacts the adaptation of a population

* Quantitative traits vs complex traits

* Heritability and additive variation - how much of gene expression is a heritable trait?

### Benefits and Limitations to using gene expression to study traits

* Can gene expression be used to identify genes not "classically" associated with a trait?

### Benefits and limitations to using gene expression to study local adaptation

* Pavey et al. 2010.
        * gene expression promotes differentiation by 1) indirectly promoting population persistence and 2) directly affect adaptive divergence in traits

* "mis" regulation as adaptive?
	
	* Baym et al. 2016. obvserved repeated, independent mutations in _dnaQ_, a proofreading DNA polymerase, that caused increased overall mutations

* **Can gene expression be used to identiy genes not "classically" associated with adaptation to an environment/climate condition?**

	* Baym et al. 2016.
		* Though they used whole genome sequencing to identify mutations, saw mutations arise in thress genes not classically associated with antibiotic resistance a number of times, and later validated the role of those genes in antibiotic resistance.


### Connections between gene expression and local adaptation

### Regulatory mechanism and the role of the contextual genome

* Cooper et al. 2003.
	* moving a beneficial allele that arose in one  population into another population with similarly high fitness but without that allele  did not increase the fitness of the new gene host.
	* it did not _decrease_ it either, in this case
